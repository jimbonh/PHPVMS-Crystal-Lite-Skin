# Phpvms-OrangePeel Skin
Multiple Skins for PHPVMS built from the Ground Up !
Our skins are designed for the following; <strong>PHP file format, NOT tpl. </strong>PHP Server version 5.6.xx, 
this will work with server version 5.3.xx,
but no promises on 5.3.xx. This is an advanced skin, we have done all the work for you, 
just upload the contents to your Server As is, make sure you upload "ALL" of the included files. 
Some things will not Work without them, especially the Reg./Login pages.
Also skin is designed for phpvms version 5.2.xx and up, nothing below this version will work at all.
This Skin is programmed in Bootstrap 4.10.xx with HTML5, this is <strong><h3>NOT</strong></h3> for the faint hearted.
