# Phpvms-OrangePeel Skin
Multiple Skins for PHPVMS built from the Ground Up !
Our skins are designed for the following; php file format, NOT tpl. PHP Server version 5.6.xx, this will work with 5.3.xx
but no promises on 5.3.xx. This is an advanced skin, we have done all the work for you, just upload the contents to your Server
As is, make sure you upload "ALL" of the included files. Some things will not Work without them, especially the Reg./Login pages.
This Skin is programmed in Bootstrap 4.10.xx with HTML5, this is Not for the faint hearted. Get help if you need it at the phpvms forums or contact me here, or in the Forums of phpvms, "Heritage1". Poke me a private message there please.
